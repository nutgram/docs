That\'s exactly how [Nutgram](https://nutgram.dev/) came to life: two developers, real problems, and a shared frustration with existing tools.\\n\\n## Where It All Started\\n\\nAbout six years ago, [Luca](https://github.com/Lukasss93) got a simple request in a Telegram group: *\\"Hey, can you rebuild this file conversion bot that just died?\\"*\\n\\nHe built [New File Converter Bot](https://t.me/newfileconverterbot) using [TelegramBotPHP](https://github.com/Eleirbag89/TelegramBotPHP). But after a few weeks, the cracks started showing. Everything was arrays - no IDE autocompletion, no type safety, just implicit structures everywhere.\\n\\nHis solution was drastic: fork the whole thing into [telegrambot-php](https://github.com/Lukasss93/telegrambot-php) and convert everything to proper objects. He manually created over 200 classes to implement DTOs. Tedious? Absolutely. Worth it? Hell yes.\\n\\nMeanwhile, I was on my own parallel journey.\\n\\n## AnonyMeetBot v1: The BotMan Era\\n\\nI had built [AnonyMeetBot](https://t.me/AnonyMeetBot) v1 using [BotMan](https://github.com/botman/botman) as an experiment to connect two platforms together: Facebook and Telegram. BotMan seemed like the perfect choice for multi-platform support.\\n\\nBut then Facebook tightened their API requirements and the Facebook support had to be dropped. AnonyMeetBot became Telegram-only, and suddenly BotMan\'s multi-platform approach felt like overkill. The Telegram implementation was incomplete and didn\'t really leverage Telegram\'s unique features.\\n\\nAs the bot grew and gained users, the problems became clear. Being an experimental project, v1 had its share of performance issues. But the real limitation was BotMan itself - too bulky, too generic, and not built to take advantage of what Telegram actually offers. I needed proper middleware, better code organization, and a framework actually built for Telegram.\\n\\nI also looked at [Zanzara](https://github.com/badfarm/zanzara), which was laser-focused on Telegram, but it got abandoned shortly after I found it.\\n\\n## Building Nutgram\\n\\nAt some point you just have to build the tool yourself. I started working on AnonyMeetBot v2 from scratch, and with it, a new framework. I took everything I\'d learned from BotMan and Zanzara and started designing something better.\\n\\nThe goal was simple: create something 100% Telegram-first, with modern developer experience and no compromises. A framework that understood conversation flows, made middleware feel natural, and gave proper structure without being too opinionated.\\n\\nOnce I had a working v1 of Nutgram, I deployed AnonyMeetBot v2. The improvements were obvious - cleaner architecture, better performance, and actually using Telegram\'s features properly.\\n\\n## Two Paths Converge\\n\\nAround that time, Luca was facing similar issues. His bots were running on telegrambot-php, but he was hitting the same architectural walls. When he discovered Nutgram, he started rewriting his old bots with it.\\n\\nAnd then something great happened: he didn\'t just use it, he started contributing. A lot. He brought fresh perspectives and pushed the framework forward with significant improvements.\\n\\nWe moved the repo into its own organization, and five years ago, Nutgram was officially born.\\n\\n## Why It Matters\\n\\nNutgram wasn\'t designed in a conference room. It was built because we couldn\'t find a good framework that provided high-level features for Telegram. Everything we tried was either too limited, too generic for multi-platform support, or abandoned.\\n\\nWe needed conversation management that actually worked, proper middleware, flexible handlers, and full support for Telegram\'s features. So we built it.\\n\\nThat\'s really all there is to it. Nutgram exists because we were frustrated with the available options and decided to make something better. Five years later, it\'s still solving the same problems for developers who want to build serious Telegram bots without fighting their framework.\\n\\n---\\n\\nWant to build your next Telegram bot with Nutgram?

Here\'s a closer look at the key changes:\\n\\n### PHP 8.2\\n\\nTo ensure a smooth transition, make sure to update your dependencies as now is required PHP 8.2.0 or greater. This\\nhigher requirement unlocks new capabilities and improvements, so be sure to prepare your environment accordingly.\\n\\n### Endpoint Signature\\n\\nOne of the significant changes in 4.x is the conversion of all endpoint signatures from an array to named\\nparameters. This update enables the convenient utilization of named parameters and improves parameter sorting. Mandatory\\nparameters now come first, followed by optional ones, while the `$clientOpt` parameter, if present, will always be\\nplaced at the end.\\n\\nFor example, previously, you might have used:\\n\\n```php\\n$bot->sendMessage(\'my text\', [\\n    \'disable_notification\' => true\\n]);\\n```\\n\\nIn 4.x, has to be changed to:\\n\\n```php\\n$bot->sendMessage(\'my text\',\\n    disable_notification: true\\n);\\n```\\n\\n### `->group` Method\\n\\nThe group method has undergone modifications in its usage. Previously, it accepted the middleware as a parameter, but\\nnow the middleware is set using the middleware method. Update your code to reflect this change:\\n\\n```php\\n$bot->group(function (Nutgram $bot){\\n    // Your handlers here\\n})->middleware(Middleware::class);\\n```\\n\\n### Enums\\n\\nIn 4.x, we have converted Attributes (Class with constants) to Enums. If you were directly using the value\\nbefore, you will now need to use `->value` to obtain the raw value. This change has a medium impact and should be\\naddressed during the upgrade.\\n\\n### Laravel Support Moved to a Separate Package\\n\\nWith the latest update, we have separated the Laravel support into a new package called `nutgram/laravel`.\\nYou have to install this package using Composer:\\n\\n```bash\\ncomposer require nutgram/laravel\\n```\\n\\nTo streamline the integration process, the previous package, `nutgram/nutgram`, is now included within `\\nnutgram/laravel`. Once you have `nutgram/laravel` installed, you can safely remove `nutgram/nutgram` as it is already\\nincorporated.\\n\\nThese high-impact changes require your attention to ensure a seamless transition to 4.x. Be sure to update\\nyour code accordingly to take full advantage of the new features and improvements.\\n\\nWe encourage you to explore the [complete upgrade guide](/docs/upgrading/from-3.x-to-4.x) and review the changes in the\\nrepository on GitHub.\\nUpgrade now and elevate your Telegram bot development to new heights.
